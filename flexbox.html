            <p>The CSS Flexbox model is a layout model that allows elements to align and distribute space within a container. 
            Items within a flex container can automatically adjust their size based on the available space, making it perfect for 
            creating responsive designs. Flexbox provides control over the direction, alignment, order, and size of items in a container, 
            without the need for floats or positioning tricks.</p>
